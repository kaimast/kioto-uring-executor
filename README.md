# A simple multithreaded wrapper around tokio-uring

*NOTE: This crate is not part of the tokio project*

Once tokio-uring has native support for multi-threading, this crate will not be maintained aymore. See the discussion [here](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring/issues/258) for more information.

## Name
To indicate this being an unofficial hack, the crate is prefixed with kioto. Kyoto is often spelled as Kioto in German, similar to how Tokyo is often spelled Tokio.
